            <p>Advanced usage#</p>
<p>See the Bootstrap docs for more advanced use cases and details about customizing stylesheets.</p>

<p>Themes#</p>
<p>React-Bootstrap is compatible with existing Bootstrap themes. Just follow the installation instructions for your theme of choice.</p>

<p>Watch out!</p>
<p>Because React-Bootstrap completely reimplements Bootstrap's JavaScript, it's not automatically compatible with themes that extend the default JavaScript behaviors.</p>

<p>Create React App</p>
If you would like to add a custom theme on your app using Create React App, they have additional documentation for Create React App and Bootstrap here

Browser support#
We aim to support all browsers supported by both React and Bootstrap.
